# Some-flask-toy
Some toy about Python flask. We may send data with Flask via `flask_app.py` or with Celery via `flask_with_time_diff.py`.

## History
Originally written in April, 2021 (and was left behind until February, 2022 since I had been too busy), yet it's just a toy.
The Celery part is not yet finished but almost done. I rearranged these files and add them to git in February, 2022.

## Future
Planning to make a tool to send emails with Flask and Celery. Will put the code here when I'm done.
